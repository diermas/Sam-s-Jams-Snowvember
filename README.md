# Sam-s-Jams-Snowvember

I am creating a game for Sam's Jams Snowvember. The theme of the jam is Colour is Everything.
I am hoping to create a puzzle-platformer type game where the player's colour affects what blocks they interact with,
and they will need to use this mechanic to navigate through the levels.
